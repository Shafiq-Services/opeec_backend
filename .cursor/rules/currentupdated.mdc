### [Equipment Duration UI Fixes - Feb 2026]
**Type:** Bug Fix / Enhancement  
**Description:** Fixed equipment duration fields display and navigation issues in Flutter app.

**Issues Fixed:**
1. **Duration values not showing when editing equipment** - Pre-filled values now correctly displayed in dropdowns
2. **Add equipment navigation** - Now properly navigates to equipment list instead of step 1 after successful add

**Flutter App Changes:**
- `equipment_details.dart`:
  - Updated `assignValues()` to use "preset" markers instead of empty type strings
  - Simplified update/add equipment to send empty dropdownIds (backend only needs selectedValue)
  - Fixed add equipment navigation to use `Navigator.pop()` like update flow
  
- `equipment_availability.dart`:
  - Added `getOptionByValue()` to find dropdown options by numeric value (not ObjectId)
  - Updated `assignValue()` to check int values and match by numeric value
  - Fixed `initState()` to re-run `assignValue()` when dropdown data loads
  - Updated `autoSelectRecommendedValues()` to respect pre-filled values
  - Updated dropdown `onChanged` handlers to mark as "selected" (no ObjectId needed)

**Backend Documentation:**
- Updated `about-project.mdc` with simplified duration field storage documentation
